# Program 1: Parking Garage using Stacks
    # In this program, the user will be able to simulate a parking garage using stack data structure.

# Program 2: Parking Garage using Queues
    # In this program, the user will be able to simulate a parking garage using queue data structure.

# Program 3: Binary Tree 
    # In this program, the user will be able to create a binary tree by inserting nodes.
    # 1. Ask the user to input how many levels they want in the binary tree.
    # 2. For each level, prompt the user to enter the value of the nodes.
    # 3. Insert the nodes into the binary tree accordingly.
    # 4. Generate the created binary tree and display it along with its traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order). 

# Program 4: Binary Search Tree
    # In this program, the user will input numbers to create a binary search tree (BST).
    # 1. Ask the user to input specific number of digits they want to insert into the BST.
    # 2. For each digit, prompt the user to enter the number.
    # 3. Insert the numbers into the BST accordingly.
    # 4. Generate the created BST and display it along with its traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

# Program 5: Tower of Hanoi using Recursion
    # In this program, the user will be able to play the Tower of Hanoi game using recursion.
